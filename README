A version of at(1) that uses a lex & yacc time parser instead of
the hand-built parser than I wrote for Linux/FreeBSD/osx at(1) in
the 1990s.

The parser handles the regular time specifications that my old one
does with the addition of the "in" keyword ("in 15 minutes")


To build:     ./configure.sh && make
To clean up:  make spotless
